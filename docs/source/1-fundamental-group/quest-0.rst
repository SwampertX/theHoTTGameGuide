Quest 0 - Working with the Circle
*********************************

In this series of quests we will prove that the fundamental group
of ``S¹`` is ``ℤ``.
In fact, our strategy will also show that the higher homotopy groups of
``S¹`` are all trivial.
You don't need to know any prerequisites - in particular we will define
the fundamental group and higher homotopy groups
if you don't know what they are already.

.. important::

   In your cloned copy of the HoTT Game locate the file
   ``1FundamentalGroup/Quest0.agda``,
   and open this file in ``emacs``.
   Before starting it is important to have a look at
   our :ref:`guide to emacs and list of emacs commands <emacsCommands>`.

.. _part0TheCircle:

Part 0 - The Circle
=====================================

Theory - Definition of the Circle
---------------------------------

We begin by formalising the problem statement.

A contruction of "the circle" is :

- a point called ``base``
- an edge from that point to itself called ``loop``

Here is our definition of the circle in ``agda``.

.. code-block:: agda

   data S¹ : Type where
     base : S¹
     loop : base ≡ base

.. image:: images/S1-final.gif
  :width: 1000
  :alt: S1

This reads :

* ``S¹`` is a point in ``Type``, the *space of spaces*.
  In other words, ``S¹`` is a space.
* ``base`` is a point in the space ``S¹``
* ``loop`` is a *path* in ``S¹`` from ``base`` to itself.
  This is phrased as saying ``loop`` is a point in ``base ≡ base``
  the *space of paths from* ``base`` *to* ``base``.

.. admonition:: Path

   We think of a path in a space ``A`` as consisting
   of its starting point, its end point,
   and some generic point in the middle
   agreeing on the boundary.

You can see this as defining the circle via a CW-complex.

.. admonition:: Type theory notation

   In general ``a : A`` is read as ``a`` is a point
   in the space ``A``.
   Note that in the above definition ``S¹`` is seen
   both as a point and a space depending on the context.
   In ``cubical agda``,
   everything is a point in a "unique" space.

.. admonition:: Type theory notation

   In general when ``a b : A``
   (``a`` and ``b`` are points in a space ``A``),
   we have a *path space* ``a ≡ b``,
   whose points are *paths* from
   ``a`` to ``b`` in the space ``A``.

Exercise - defining the constant path ``Refl``
----------------------------------------------

There are other paths in ``S¹``,
for example the *constant path at* ``base``.
In ``1FundamentalGroup/Quest0.agda`` navigate to

.. code-block:: agda

   Refl : base ≡ base
   Refl = {!!}

We will guide you through defining it.
We are about to construct a path ``Refl : base ≡ base``,
a path from ``base`` to ``base``.

.. tip::

   The ``{!!}`` are called *holes*.
   These are blanks in the ``agda`` file that you can fill
   to complete the quest.
   You can write ``?`` to make a new hole.

We will fill the hole ``Refl = {!!}``.

* Make sure you are in :ref:`insert mode <emacsCommands>` by pressing ``i``.
  To escape *insert mode* press ``ESC``.

  .. NOTE::

     We have compiled a list of useful ``emacs`` and ``agda`` commands in
     :ref:`Emacs Commands <emacsCommands>`.

* Enter ``C-c C-l`` (this means ``Ctrl-c Ctrl-l``).
Whenever you do this, ``agda`` will check the document is written correctly.
  We say ``agda`` *compiles*  or *loads* the file.
  This will open the ``*Agda Information*`` window looking like

  .. code-block::

     ?0 : base ≡ base
     ?1 : (something)
     ?2 : (something)
     ...

  This is the list of unfilled holes that are in your file currently.
  You should see that the holes in the file have changed in appearance,
  for example :

  .. code-block:: agda

     Refl : base ≡ base
     Refl = { }0

  These are what holes look like when the file is compiled.
  The numbering is just for reference and may change upon reloading.
* :ref:`Navigate between holes <emacsCommands>` using ``C-c C-f`` (forward)
  or ``C-c C-b`` (backward).
* Navigate to the first hole, making sure your cursor is inside the hole.
  :ref:`Check the goal <emacsCommands>` using ``C-c C-,`` (this means ``Ctrl-c Ctrl-comma``).
  Whenever you do ``C-c C-,``, ``agda`` will tell you what kind of "point" it expects in the hole.
  The ``*Agda Information*`` window should be focused on this hole only :

  .. code::

     Goal: base ≡ base

  This says ``agda`` is expecting a path from ``base`` to ``base`` in the hole.
  Making sure your cursor is still inside the hole, enter ``C-c C-r``.
  The ``r`` stands for :ref:`refine <emacsCommands>`.
  Whenever you do this whilst having your cursor in a hole,
  ``agda`` will try to help you.
* You should now see ``λ i → {!!}``.
  This is the ``agda`` way of writing ``i ↦ {!!}``.
  Load the file again (using ``C-c C-l``) and
  the ``*Agda Information*`` window should now look like :

  .. code-block::

     ?0 : S¹
     ...
     ?6 : (something)

     ———— Errors ———————————————
     Failed to solve the following constraints:
       ?0 (i = i1) = base : S¹ (blocked on _3)
       ?0 (i = i0) = base : S¹ (blocked on _3)

  Do not worry about the errors,
  we will soon explain it.

* Navigate (``C-c C-f`` and ``C-c C-b``) to that new hole in ``λ i → {!!}`` and
  enter ``C-c C-,`` to  :ref:`check the goal <emacsCommands>`.
  The ``*Agda information*`` window should look like :

  .. code-block::

     Goal: S¹
     —————————————————————————
     i : I
     ———— Constraints ——————————————
     ?0 (i = i1) = base : S¹ (blocked on _3, belongs to problem 4)
     ?0 (i = i0) = base : S¹ (blocked on _3, belongs to problem 4)
     _4 := λ i → ?0 (i = i) (blocked on problem 4)

  This says :

  * ``agda`` is expecting a point in ``S¹`` for this hole.
  * you have a point ``i`` in ``I`` available to you.
    You can think of ``I`` as the "unit interval"
    and ``i`` as a generic point in the interval.
  * The point in ``S¹`` that you give has to satisfy the constraints that
    it is ``base`` when "``i = 1``" and "``i = 0``".
    In ``agda``, ``i0`` and ``i1`` are the "start" and "end" point of ``I``.
    Afterall, we are defining a path from ``base`` to itself.
  * Don't worry about the last line.

* Since ``Refl`` is meant to be the constant path at ``base``,
  write ``base`` in the hole.
* Press ``C-c C-SPC`` to fill the hole with ``base``.
  In general when you have some text (and your cursor) in a hole,
  doing ``C-c C-SPC`` will tell ``agda`` to replace the hole with that text.
  ``agda`` will give you an error if it can't make sense of your text.

  .. tip::

     Everytime you are filling a hole,
     it is recommended that you first write what you want to fill
     in the hole *then* do ``C-c C-SPC``.
     You can do it in the reverse order,
     however the recommended order has other benefits down the line.

* Load the file again (``C-c C-l``).
  The ``*Agda Information*`` window should now look like this :

  .. code-block:: agda

     ?0 : Bool
     ?1 : Bool ≅ Bool
     ?2 : Bool ≡ Bool
     ?3 : Type
     ?4 : doubleCover base
     ?5 : ⊥

  The ``?0 : S¹`` has disappeared.
  This means ``agda`` has accepted what you filled this hole with.
* If you want to play around with this you reset this question
  by replacing what you wrote with ``?`` and doing
  ``C-c C-l``.

.. _part1ReflEquivLoopIsEmpty:

Part 1 -  ``Refl ≡ loop`` is empty
==================================

To get a better feel of ``S¹``,
we show that the space of paths (homotopies) between
``Refl`` and ``loop``, written ``Refl ≡ loop``, is empty.

.. admonition:: Paths between paths

   In general if we have ``p q : a ≡ b`` in a space ``A``
   then a path ``Path : p ≡ q`` in the path space ``a ≡ b``
   consists of

   - the starting path ``p``
   - the end path ``q``
   - and some generic path in between ``Path i : a ≡ b``
     that agrees on the boundary

   .. raw:: html

      <video controls width="600">

          <source src="../_static/pathSpace.webm"
                  type="video/webm">
                  
      </video>

   In algebraic topology this is called a *path homotopy*.

First, we define the empty space and what it means for a space to be empty.
Here is what this looks like in ``agda`` :

.. code-block:: agda

   data ⊥ : Type where

This says "the empty space ``⊥`` is a space with no points in it".

Here are three candidate definitions for a space ``A`` to be empty :

* there is a point ``f : A → ⊥``
  in the space of functions from ``A`` to the empty space
* there is a path ``p : A ≡ ⊥``
  in the space of spaces ``Type`` from ``A`` to the empty space
* there is an isomorphism ``i : A ≅ ⊥`` of spaces

These turn out to be "the same"
(see :ref:`differentNotionsOfEmpty`),
however for our present purposes we will use the first definition.
Our goal is therefore to produce a point in the function space

.. code-block:: agda

   ( Refl ≡ loop ) → ⊥

The authors of this series have thought long and hard
about how one would come up with the following argument.
Unfortunately, sometimes mathematics is in need of a new trick
and this was one of them.

.. admonition:: The trick

   We make a path ``p : true ≡ false``
   from the assumed path (homotopy) ``h : Refl ≡ loop`` by
   constructing a non-trivial ``Bool``-bundle over the circle,
   hence obtaining a map ``( Refl ≡ loop ) → ⊥``.

To elaborate :
``Bool`` here refers to the discrete space with two points ``true, false``.
We will create a map ``doubleCover : S¹ → Type`` that sends
``base`` to ``Bool`` and the path ``loop`` to
a non-trivial path ``flipPath : Bool ≡ Bool`` in the space of spaces.

..

             type="video/webm">

   </video>


Viewing the picture vertically,
for each point ``x : S¹``,
we call ``doubleCover x`` the *fiber of* ``doubleCover`` *over* ``x``.
All the fibers look like ``Bool``, hence our choice of the name ``Bool``- \*bundle*.

.. admonition:: Homotopy type theory

   A path ``p : X ≡ Y`` between two *spaces* ``X Y : Type``
   (viewed as points in the space of spaces)
   can be visualised as follows :

   * Two spaces ``X`` and ``Y`` as end points.
   * For the generic point ``i : I`` in the interval
     ``p i : Type`` is a space that varies continuously with to respect to ``i``
     such that ``p 0`` is ``X`` and ``p 1`` is ``Y``.

   The continuity guarantees that each point along the path looks "the same".
   In particular the end points look "the same".

We will get a path from ``true`` to ``false``
in the fiber of ``doubleCover`` over ``base``
by "lifting the homotopy" ``h : Refl ≡ loop`` and
considering the end points of the "lifted paths".
``Refl`` will "lift" to a "constant path" and ``loop`` will "lift" to

.. image:: images/lifted_loops.png
  :width: 1000
  :alt: liftedPaths

Let's assume for the moment that we have ``flipPath`` already and
define ``doubleCover``.

* Make sure you are in :ref:`insert mode <emacsCommands>`.
* Navigate to the definition of ``doubleCover`` and make sure
  you have :ref:`loaded the file <emacsCommands>` with ``C-c C-l``.

  .. code-block:: agda

     doubleCover : S¹ → Type
     doubleCover x = {!!}

* :ref:`Navigate to the hole <emacsCommands>` and :ref:`check the goal<emacsCommands>`.
  It should look like

  .. code::

     Goal: Type
     ————————————————————
     x : S¹

  This says it is expecting a point in ``Type``, the space of spaces,
  i.e. it expects a space.
  We will first :ref:`case on x <emacsCommands>`
  by writing ``x`` in the hole and doing ``C-c C-c`` (``c`` for cases).
  You should now see two new holes :

  .. code-block:: agda

     doubleCover : S¹ → Type
     doubleCover base = {!!}
     doubleCover (loop i) = {!!}

  This means :
  ``S¹`` is made from a point ``base`` and an edge ``loop``,
  so a map out of ``S¹`` to a space is the same as choosing
  a point to map ``base`` to, and an edge to map ``loop`` to respectively.
  Since ``loop`` is a path from ``base`` to itself,
  its image must also be a path from the image of ``base`` to itself.
* :ref:`Navigate <emacsCommands>` to the first new hole and :ref:`check the goal<emacsCommands>`.
  We want to map ``base`` to the space ``Bool`` so
  write ``Bool`` in the hole, then do ``C-c C-SPC`` to :ref:`fill <emacsCommands>` it.
* :ref:`Navigate <emacsCommands>` to the second new hole and :ref:`check the goal<emacsCommands>`.
  Here ``loop i`` is a generic point in the path ``loop``,
  where ``i : I`` is a generic point of the "unit interval".
  We are assuming we have ``flipPath`` defined already
  and want to map ``loop`` to ``flipPath``,
  so ``loop i`` should map to a generic point in the path ``flipPath``.

  .. NOTE::

     We can use ``flipPath`` without completing the definition of ``flipPath``.

  Try filling the hole.
* Once you think you are done, :ref:`reload <emacsCommands>` the ``agda`` file with ``C-c C-l``
  and if it doesn't complain
  this means there are no problems with your definition.
  Compare your definition to that in ``1FundamentalGroup/Quest0Solutions.agda``
  to check that your definition is the one we want.
  To navigate to solutions file escape *insert mode* using ``ESC`` and do ``SPC f f``
  to find the file, see :ref:`emacsCommands`.
  Here is a definition that ``agda`` will accept, but is *not* what we need:

     <p>
     <details>
     <summary>Bad definition</summary>

     doubleCover : S¹ → Type

     </p>


Defining ``flipPath`` is quite involved and we will do so in the following part.

.. _part2DefiningFlipPathViaUnivalence:

Part 2 - Defining ``flipPath`` via Univalence
=============================================

In this part, we will define the path ``flipPath : Bool ≡ Bool``.
Recall the picture of ``doubleCover``.

.. _doubleCoverAnimation2:

..
   .. image:: images/doubleCover-final.gif
     :width: 1000
     :alt: doubleCover

This means we need ``flipPath`` to correspond to
the unique non-identity permutation of ``Bool``
that flips ``true`` and ``false``.

The function
------------

We proceed in steps :

1. Define the function ``Flip : Bool → Bool``.
2. Promote this to an isomorphism ``flipIso : Bool ≅ Bool``.
3. We use *univalence* to turn ``flipIso`` into
   a path ``flipPath : Bool ≡ Bool``.
   The univalence axiom asserts that
   paths in ``Type`` - the space of spaces - correspond to
   homotopy-equivalences of spaces.
   As a corollary,
   we can make paths in ``Type`` from isomorphisms in ``Type``.

.. admonition:: Isomorphism

   One with a topological mindset might worry if isomorphism means
   homeomorphism, homotopy equivalence, bijection or something else;
   one might even wonder what *continuity* is here.
   The answer is that this is *synthetic homotopy theory*,
   where

   - there is *no need for real numbers*
   - every map is continuous in the sense that they respect paths
   - an isomorphism ``A ≅ B`` is given by the data of

     - ``fun : A → B``
     - ``inv : B → A``
     - ``rightInv`` that says (extensionally) ``fun ∘ inv`` is homotopic to the identity,
       i.e. given any ``b : B`` we have a path ``fun ∘ inv b ≡ b``.
     - ``leftInv`` that says (extensionally) ``inv ∘ fun`` is homotopic to the identity.

     You might notice that the above looks like the classical
     definition of homotopy equivalence. (They turn out to be "the same".)

.. admonition:: Univalence

   We have described paths between points as giving a starting point,
   an ending point, and a generic point between that agrees on the boundary.
   Drawing a path between *spaces* in the *space of spaces*,
   we can see that such a path is the data of two
   spaces that "continuously look the same":

   .. insert picture

   We already have a notion of "the same" for spaces,
   which is isomorphism.
   Hence we assume the following "univalence" axiom :
   Any isomorphism can be turned into a path between spaces.

* In ``1FundamentalGroup/Quest0.agda``, navigate to :

.. code-block:: agda

  Flip : Bool → Bool
  Flip x = {!!}

* Make sure you are in :ref:`insert mode<emacsCommands>`.
* :ref:`Check the goal<emacsCommands>`.
  It should be asking for a point in ``Bool``,
  since we have already given it an ``x : Bool`` at the front.

.. tip::

   Whenever you encounter a new hole, you should first :ref:`check the goal<emacsCommands>`.

* Write ``x`` inside the hole,
  and :ref:`case <emacsCommands>` on ``x`` using ``C-c C-c`` with your cursor still inside.
  You should now see :

  .. code-block:: agda

    Flip : Bool → Bool
    Flip false = {!!}
    Flip true = {!!}

  This means :
  the space ``Bool`` is made of two points ``false, true`` and nothing else,
  so to map out of ``Bool`` it suffices
  to find images for ``false`` and ``true`` respectively.
* Since we want ``Flip`` to flip ``true`` and ``false``,
  fill the first hole with ``true`` and the second with ``false``.
* To check things have worked,
  try ``C-c C-d`` (``d`` stands for :ref:`deduce its space <emacsCommands>`).
  Then ``agda`` will ask you to input an expression.
  Enter ``Flip``.
  In the ``*Agda Information*`` window,
  you should see

  .. code-block:: agda

    Bool → Bool

  This means ``agda`` recognises ``Flip`` as a well-formulated term
  and is a point in the space of maps from ``Bool`` to ``Bool``.
* We can also ask ``agda`` to compute outputs of ``Flip``.
  Try ``C-c C-n`` (``n`` stands for :ref:`normalise <emacsCommands>`),
  ``agda`` should again be asking for an expression.
  Enter ``Flip true``.
  In the ``*Agda Information*`` window, you should see ``false``, as desired.

.. _part2DefiningFlipPathViaUnivalenceTheIsomorphism:

The isomorphism
---------------

* :ref:`Navigate <emacsCommands>` to

  .. code-block:: agda

    flipIso : Bool ≅ Bool
    flipIso = {!!}

* :ref:`Refine <emacsCommands>` with ``C-c C-r``.
  You should now see

  .. code-block:: agda

    flipIso : Bool ≅ Bool
    flipIso = iso {!!} {!!} {!!} {!!}

* Given two spaces ``A`` and ``B``,
  ``iso`` (with respect to ``A`` and ``B``) belongs to the following space :

  .. code-block::

     iso : (fun : A → B) (inv : B → A)
           (rightInv : section fun inv) (leftInv : retract fun inv) →
           A ≅ B

  which says that ``iso`` will produce an isomorphism from ``A`` to ``B``
  given a map ``fun`` forwards and an inverse ``inv`` backwards,
  and points of the space ``section fun inv`` and ``retract fun inv``.
  Try to find out what ``section`` and ``retract`` are
  by doing ``C-c C-n`` and entering their respective names.
  They should respectively say that
  ``inv`` is a right and left inverse of ``fun``.

* :ref:`Check the first two holes <emacsCommands>`,
  ``agda`` should expect functions ``Bool → Bool``
  to go in both of them.
  This is because it is expecting a function and its inverse,
  respectively,
  so fill them with ``Flip`` and its inverse ``Flip``.
* Check the goal of the next two holes.
  They should be

  .. code-block::

    section Flip Flip

  and

  .. code-block::

     retract Flip Flip

* Add the following to your code (make sure you copy it exactly) :

  .. code-block:: agda

    flipIso : Bool ≅ Bool
    flipIso = iso Flip Flip {!!} {!!} where

      rightInv : section Flip Flip
      rightInv x = {!!}

      leftInv : retract Flip Flip
      leftInv x = {!!}

  Then :ref:`load <emacsCommands>` the file with ``C-c C-l``.
  If ``agda`` gives an error it could be due to

  1. missing spaces; ``agda`` is space sensitive
  2. wrong indentation before ``rightInv`` and ``leftInv``; ``agda`` is intentation sensitive
  3. missing the ``where`` in the second line.
  4. lower and upper case differences

  .. admonition:: where to use ``where``

     The ``where`` allows you to make definitions local to the current definition,
     in the sense that you will not be able to access
     ``rightInv`` and ``leftInv`` outside this proof.
     We will eventually fill the missing holes from before with ``rightInv`` and ``leftInv``.
     If you like you can also place the definitions of
     ``rightInv`` and ``leftInv`` before ``flipIso``.

           flipIso = iso Flip Flip {!!} {!!} where

              rightInv : section Flip Flip
              rightInv = {!!}

              leftInv : retract Flip Flip
              leftInv = {!!}

     * :ref:`Check the goal <emacsCommands>` of the hole ``rightInv = {!!}``
       and try using ``C-c C-r``.
       It should give you ``λ x → {!!}``.
       This says it's asking for something for each ``x : Bool``.
       (Recall that ``λ x → {!!}`` is the ``agda`` notation for
       ``x ↦ {!!}``.)
       If you check the goal you can find out what it wants
       and that you have available ``x : Bool``.
     * To do a proof for each ``x : Bool``, we can also just stick
       ``x`` before the ``=`` and do away with the ``λ`` like this :

       .. code-block:: agda

          flipIso : Bool ≅ Bool
          flipIso = iso Flip Flip {!!} {!!} where

             rightInv : section Flip Flip
             rightInv x = {!!}

             leftInv : retract Flip Flip
             leftInv = {!!}

     .. raw:: html

        </details>
        </p>

* :ref:`Check the goal <emacsCommands>` of the hole ``rightInv x = {!!}``.
  In the ``*Agda Information*`` window, you should see

  .. code-block:: agda

     Goal: Flip (Flip x) ≡ x
     —————————————————————————————————
     x : Bool

  This says ``rightInv`` should give for each ``x : Bool`` a path ``p : Flip (Flip x) ≡ x``.
  We gave an ``x : Bool`` in front, so the goal is simply to give a path ``p : Flip (Flip x) ≡ x``.
  Try to give such a path.

  .. raw:: html

     <p>
     <details>
     <summary>Hint</summary>

  You need to :ref:`case <emacsCommands>` on what ``x`` can be.
  Then for the case of ``false``,
  ``Flip (Flip false)`` should just be ``false`` by design,
  so you need to give a path from ``false`` to ``false``.

  The benefit of having ``x`` before the ``=``
  is that we can case on what ``x`` can be.
  This is called *pattern matching*.

  .. raw:: html

     </details>
     </p>

* Do the same for ``leftInv x = {!!}``.
* Fill in the missing goals from the original problem using ``rightInv``, ``leftInv``.
* If you got the definition right then ``agda``
  should not have any errors when you load using ``C-c C-l``.

The path
--------

* :ref:`Navigate <emacsCommands>` to

  .. code-block:: agda

    flipPath : Bool ≡ Bool
    flipPath = {!!}

* In the hole, write in ``isoToPath`` and refine with ``C-c C-r``.
  You should now have

  .. code-block:: agda

    flipPath : Bool ≡ Bool
    flipPath = isoToPath {!!}

  If you check the new hole, you should see that
  ``agda`` is expecting an isomorphism ``Bool ≅ Bool``.

  ``isoToPath`` is the function from the cubical library
  that converts isomorphisms between spaces
  into paths between the corresponding points in the space of spaces ``Type``.
* Fill in the hole with ``flipIso``
  and use ``C-c C-d`` to check ``agda`` is happy with ``flipPath``.
* Try to :ref:`normalise <emacsCommands>` ``pathToFun flipPath false``.
  You should get ``true`` in the ``*Agda Information*`` window.

  What ``pathToFun`` did is it took the path ``flipPath`` in the
  space of spaces ``Type`` and followed the point ``false``
  as ``Bool`` is transformed along ``flipPath``.
  The end result is of course ``true``,
  since ``flipPath`` is the path obtained from ``flip``!
  Try to follow what ``pathToFun`` does in the
  :ref:`animation<doubleCoverAnimation2>`.

  .. admonition:: ``pathToFun``

    ``pathToFun`` is called ``transport`` in the cubical
    library.

Part 3 - Lifting paths using ``doubleCover``
============================================

By the end of this page we will have shown that
``refl ≡ loop`` is an empty space.
In ``1FundamentalGroup/Quest0.agda`` locate

.. code-block:: agda

   Refl≢loop : Refl ≡ loop → ⊥
   Refl≢loop h = ?

The cubical library has the result
``true≢false : true ≡ false → ⊥``
which says that the space of paths in ``Bool``
from ``true`` to ``false`` is empty.
We will assume it here and leave the proof as a side quest,
see :ref:`trueNequivFalse`.

* Load the file with ``C-c C-l`` and navigate to the hole.
  Write ``true≢false``
  (input ``\==n`` for ``≢``; see :ref:`emacsCommands`)
  in the hole and refine using ``C-c C-r``,
  ``agda`` knows ``true≢false`` maps to ``⊥`` so it automatically
  will make a new hole.
* Check the goal in the new hole using ``C-c C-,``
  it should be asking for a path from ``true`` to ``false``.

To give this path we need to visualise "lifting" ``Refl``, ``loop``
and the homotopy ``h : Refl ≡ loop``
along the Bool-bundle ``doubleCover``.
When we "lift" ``Refl`` - starting at the point ``true : doubleCover base`` -
it will still be a constant path at ``true``,
drawn as a dot ``true``.
When we "lift" ``loop`` - starting at the point ``true : doubleCover base`` -
it will look like

.. image:: images/lifted_loops.png
  :width: 1000
  :alt: liftedPaths

The homotopy ``h : Refl ≡ loop`` is "lifted"
(starting at "lifted ``Refl``")
to some kind of surface

.. image:: images/lifted_homotopy.png
  :width: 1000
  :alt: liftedHomotopy

According to the pictures the end point of the "lifted"
``Refl`` is ``true`` and the end point of the "lifted" ``loop`` is ``false``.
We are interested in the end points of each
"lifted paths" in the "lifted homotopy",
since this forms a path in the endpoint fiber ``doubleCover base``
from ``true`` to ``false``.

We can evaluate the end points of both "lifted paths" by using
something in the cubical library (called ``subst``) which we call ``endPt``.

.. code-block:: agda

   endPt : (B : A → Type) (p : x ≡ y) (bx : B x) → B y

.. NOTE::

   It says given a bundle ``B`` over space ``A``,
   a path ``p`` from ``x : A`` to ``y : A``, and
   a point ``bx`` above ``x``,
   we can get the end point of "lifted ``p`` starting at ``bx``".
   So let's make the function that takes
   a path from ``base`` to ``base`` and spits out the end point
   of the "lifted paths" starting at ``true``.

..
  insert image of endPt

.. code-block:: agda

   endPtOfTrue : base ≡ base → doubleCover base
   endPtOfTrue p = {!!}

- :ref:`Check the goal<emacsCommands>`.
  It should be asking for

  .. code::

     Goal: Bool
     —————————————————————————─
     p : base ≡ base
     ———— Constraints ———————————————
     ?0 (p = loop) = false : Bool
       (blocked on _29, belongs to problem 90)
     ?0 (p = Refl) = true : Bool (blocked on _29, belongs to problem 90)
     _40 := λ p i → endPtOfTrue (p i) (blocked on problem 90)

- We want to use ``endPt``, which can output something in the space ``B y``
  (as described above).
  In this case we want ``B y`` to be ``Bool``.
  ``agda`` is smart and can figure out how to use ``endPt`` :

  1. Type ``endPt`` into the hole and do ``C-c C-r``.

  .. tip::

     In general if the goal of the hole

     .. code::

        Goal: Y
        ————————————————————————
        f : X → Y
        ...

     is to find a point in a space ``Y``
     and you have a function ``f : X → Y`` then you can write ``f``
     in the hole and do ``C-c C-r``.

  You should see

  .. code:: agda

     endPtOfTrue : base ≡ base → doubleCover base
     endPtOfTrue p = endPt {!!} {!!} {!!}

  2. :ref:`Check these new holes<emacsCommands>`.
  3. Try to fill in these holes.

- Once you think you are done,
  you can verify our expectation that ``endPtOfTrue Refl`` is ``true``
  and ``endPtOfTrue loop`` is ``false`` using ``C-c C-n``.

Lastly we need to make the function ``endPtOfTrue``
take the path ``h : Refl ≡ loop`` to a path from ``true`` to ``false``.
In general if ``f : A → B`` is a function and ``p`` is a path
between points ``x y : A`` then we get a map ``cong f p``
from ``f x`` to ``f y``.
(Note that ``p`` here is actually a homotopy ``h``.)

.. code-block:: agda

   cong : (f : A → B) → (p : x ≡ y) → f x ≡ f y

We will define ``cong`` in a :ref:`side quest<definingCong>`
Using ``cong`` and ``endPtOfTrue`` you should be able to complete ``Quest0``.
If you have done everything correctly you can reload ``agda`` and see that
you have no remaining goals.
